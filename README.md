# bosh-release-docs

A theme and scripts for generating documentation about a BOSH release.

**Unstable** -- this is experimental while I'm trying it out in a few of my releases. Eventually it might be something which is more easily reusable by other releases. Get in touch if you're interested in helping provide feedback or improvements to help that process.


## Notes

 * Hugo-based; this contains a theme for it.
 * Not the cleanest use of Hugo content concepts (e.g. release versions as sections with multiple content types within them).
 * Theme files should be cleaned up; forked from [dpb587/ssoca](https://github.com/dpb587/ssoca/tree/docs-hugo-site).
 * Documentation is segmented by major version.
